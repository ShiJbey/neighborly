Welcome to Neighborly's documentation!
======================================

.. attention:: Sections of this documentation may be outdated. Many changes were made between versions 2 and 3 in an effort to simplify generation and content authoring. Thank you for your understanding!

Neighborly is an agent-based settlement simulation for emergent narrative storytelling and data analysis. It simulates generations of procedurally generated characters living within a settlement with a particular focus on their relationships and life events (starting a new job, falling in love, turning into a demon, etc.). It combines social simulation elements, like relationship tracking, with RPG elements, such as character stats and skills, to generate backstories about characters and their families.

Neighborly simulates characters' traits, statuses, relationships, occupations, and life events and makes the entire simulated history available for data analysis and game development.

Neighborly's was inspired by `Talk of the Town <https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown>`_ and aims to be a more customizable and user-friendly alternative to support research or entertainment projects. It also draws inspiration from commercial simulation-driven emergent narrative games like *Caves of Qud*, *Dwarf Fortress*, *Crusader Kings*, *RimWorld*, and *WorldBox*.

How to use these docs
---------------------

This documentation explains the core building blocks of Neighborly and how to get started simulating your own procedurally generated settlements. It contains tutorial content, various how-to guides, and API references. If you would like to try Neighborly without downloading it, here is a `Google Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WxZnCR8afekfBl-vI6WcIcS6OhRGdkam?usp=sharing>`_ that generates a basic town and lets you explore generated character data.
